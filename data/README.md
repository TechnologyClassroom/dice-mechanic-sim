What is a CSV file?  CSV stands for comma separated values.  It is a very simple spreadsheet with each row being a new line and each column separated by commas.

The csv files can be opened with popular spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel.  A plain text editor can also view the files quickly.

Data analysis software and programming languages can be used to parse the data.

Data can be graphed with spreadsheet software or within python through matplotlib, plotly, networkx, or igraph.
