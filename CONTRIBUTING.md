# Contributing to DMS

If you would like to make a contribution to Midnight Riders, you could be a
part of a published game!

Pull requests will be accepted as long as they are working towards the
stated goals.  Goals for the project can be found in the [goals.md file]
(https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/dice-mechanic-sim/blob/master/docs/goals.md").

## First Steps towards a pull request

* [Make a GitHub account]((https://github.com/signup/free).
* (Optional) Check the [Issues page](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/dice-mechanic-sim/issues)
for something you can contribute towards.
  * (Optional) Submit a [new issue](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/dice-mechanic-sim/issues/new)
  for something that you would like to see changed.
* Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.  This will redirect you to a new
page titled YOURUSERNAME / dice-mechanic-sim.

## Pull request

* Create a new branch from your fork.
* Make changes.
* An option to create a pull request will appear at the top of the main page.
* Explain the reasoning behind the change in the pull request.

## Low hanging fruit

* I use minimalistic text editors without spell check.  US grammar corrections
will be accepted.
* If something is worded awkwardly, submit a pull request to add clarity.

## Style

As of this time, I have not used a style guide.  Attempt to make contributions
loosely fit in.  Example: If everything around your contributions is in all
lowercase letters and your contribution is all capital letters, it will look
bad.  I would probably still accept it if it worked towards the goals though.

If you wanted to convert the code to pep 8 format, I would accept the change and
update this section.
