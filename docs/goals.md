# Goals & Feature requests

## Game balance goals

Goals for the game mechanics to become more fun and balanced:

1) Numbers and dice should consistently increase as the game progresses
2) The game should end in close matches
3) High probability of event 7
4) Low probability of getting stuck at the first dice tier
5) Low probability of leaving a player left behind

Data analysis can be achieved by watching simulations over time or with data
analysis.

## Experiments

- What are the results when only PC vs PC occurs?
- What are the results when only PC vs NPC occurs?
- What are the results of all players choosing maximum points?
- What are the results of all players choosing minimum points?
- Compare Event 7 resolution methods

## builddatapack.sh Feature requests

- [ ] Medium: Convert to pure python without gpicview or zip dependency.
  - [ ] Replace zip with zipfile module

## dicemechanicsim.py Feature requests

- [ ] Easy: create setup.py.
- [ ] Easy: Translate this document into github issues.
- [ ] Easy: Change variable numbers to improve
  [game balance](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/dice-mechanic-sim/blob/master/docs/goals.md#game-balance-goals)
  and propose changes for dice tiers and points.
- [ ] Medium: [Create strategies for the players (Fake AI)](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/dice-mechanic-sim/issues/5)
  - [ ] Turn delta section into a function.
  - [ ] A new array will be created at the beginning of each scene that would
    calculate the possible scores for each conflict.
  - [ ] Applying strategy involves the PC choosing the opponent that yields a
    balance of the highests points with lowest risk.
- [ ] Easy: [Only load pieces of libraries that are used](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/dice-mechanic-sim/issues/4)
- [ ] Medium: Create a player generator to add flavor from MR using classes
- [ ] Medium: [Event 7 needs to match first printing.](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/dice-mechanic-sim/issues/6)
  - [ ] Bracket system that pits all runner up PCs against each other to decide
    who faces the player with the highest madness.
  - [ ] The last two players in the bracket may team up.
  - [ ] Final Event 7 battle is a best 2 out of 3 with the highest madness
    player against the winner of the bracket.
  - [ ] D12 will settle ties during event 7.
  - [ ] Event 7 edge case: If 2 or more players tie for highest madness, roll
    off with D12.  The winner of all D12 rolls has the highest madness and
    must be stopped by the winner of the bracket.
  - [ ] Event 7 edge case: What happens when two players tie for highest
    madness and repuatation?
- [ ] Medium: [Apply happening modifiers to the simulation.](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/dice-mechanic-sim/issues/7)
  - [ ] Medium: Fight a random number of opponents in special happenings.
- [ ] Advanced: Include CI workflow with tox.ini.
- [ ] Advanced: Add an option for interactive play.

## Data Analysis Feature requests

- [ ] Medium: [Analyse statistics from multiple csv files.](https://github.com/TechnologyClassroom/dice-mechanic-sim/issues/12)
- [ ] Advanced: Create a secondary system that analyzes the output and changes.
  the variables in dicemechanicsim.py autonomously.
- [ ] Advanced: Update code to work with the latest pandas.

## roll Feature requests

- [ ] Advanced: Add to pip.

## setup*.sh Feature requests

- [ ] Add logging.
- [ ] Add log files to `.gitignore`.

## Documentation Feature requests

- [ ] Emphasize that this repository is not needed to play or enjoy Midnight Riders.  Instead this repo was used to help design and balance Midnight Riders.  Future insight from this repo could help improve Midnight Riders, other tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), or board games.
- [ ] Medium: docs/gamelogic Event 7 needs an update to the bracket system from
  the first edition of Midnight Riders.
- [ ] Update the doc folder to sphinx-doc style documenation.

## Testing Feature requests
- [ ] Test changes to `setuptoxtestenvironment.sh`.
- [ ] Add alternative pip installation method to `setuptoxtestenvironment.sh`.
- [ ] Easy-Advanced: Write py.test tests for full coverage.
- [ ] Easy: Create test_dicemechanicsim.py.
- [ ] Easy: Create test_plotdicemechanic.py.
- [ ] Easy: Create test_plotcsv.py.
- [ ] Medium: Configure dependencies so output from numpy is not seen.
- [ ] Easy: Add travis-ci to github.
- [ ] Easy: Add CI to gitlab.
